/*
    DOCUMENTATION:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This service is used to watch the folder where orders from client are received.
    To implement this service the Watch API, provided by java.nio package, was used.
    The usage of this service would block the main thread that means that you canâ€™t do anything else in your code
    while polling for file changes in your directory.

    In order to solve this problem an asynchronous running was necessary.
    The "watchDirectory()" method doesn't return any value, so I'll create a class which implements the "Runnable"
    interface. After the implementation of the Runnable Class, this one will execute on a separated thread.
